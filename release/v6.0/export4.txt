Refer to dodecahedron.png for hexiamond placement.
Result format:
Correct result number: amount of correct triplets - hexiamonds (listed in the order from 1 to 12, like on the image) = triplets (triangles), resulting from the placement.*
*If the program checks for 19 combinations, the wrong triplet (a triplet that isn't in the list) will be written in the part where the star is. It looks like this:"; wrong - triplet".

The results might repeat themselves. To reduce the amount of such occurences, the use of a service that removes duplicate lines is advised.
