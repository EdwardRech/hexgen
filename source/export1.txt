Refer to tetrahedron.png for hexiamond placement.
Result format:
Hexiamonds (listed in the order from 1 to 4, like on the image) = triplets (triangles), resulting from the placement.


The results might repeat themselves. To reduce the amount of such occurences, the use of a service that removes duplicate lines is advised.
